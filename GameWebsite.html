            <h3>New News</h3>
            <p>
            When Badlur's Gate 3 came out I wasn't realy intreset about this game. I didn't even know that the game was
            released and also I didn't hear any infromation about the game before the premier because game didn't had big 
            hype and much advertisment. After one week after release date I strated to hear much more about the game in
            my job, and after evryday the hype was even biger. I even started to see some videos on the internet about the
            game.
            </p>
            <h3>hehe</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>
            So I decided to check it out, when I saw that the game producer is Larian it really concerned me. Why?
            Because I tried to play thier last game named "Original Sin 2" and I have to addmit that I really didn't like that
            game. For my, I just created my character, went into big world and had no idea what should I do. I got killed few
            times on some side quest (if I'm not wrong). I was pretty frustrated at that point so decided to go for main quest
            and I saw no npc to talk to and I was lost again so I just decided to drop that game at this point because I didn't
            have much fun at this point and also the turn fight model wasn't my thing and I find it boring at this time.

            <h3>hehe</h3>
            <p>
            So what finnaly decided that I want to try out this game ? It was my friend in my job who told me that he this game
            is amazing and he is extremaly addicted to it. I told him about my concerns about this game and the last journey I had
            with "Original Sin 2", and guess what? He also told me that he didn't liked the previous game from Larian but he is
            completely in love in this one and he convinced me to try it. And ohh God I have to thank him for that a lot.
